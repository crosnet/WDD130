        <h1>Hello</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Emmanuel, I come from Accra, Ghana in the Western Region of Africa.
            I am the second of four children, three boys and one girl and I am single. I really like everything that has to do with technology.
            I am pursuing a degree in applied technology and hope to become a full stack developer or support specialist. 
            I have tried creating websites without coding but now I want to do with coding. I have learn the basics of programming and I found it really interesting. 
            It has made me develop the interest to learn web designing and programming. In my free time, I love to play with my younger brothers,
            and also do some research on newer technologies. My favorite cartoon anime is Naruto Shippuden and my favorite food is 
            Ghanaian Jollof rice with fried chicken.

            One thing I love about BYU is the way the gospel of Jesus Christ has been added to the
            course structure to help student develop christlike attributes as they pursue their respective degrees.
            Studying this course, I hope to gain much knowledge in web desgning and to become a fullstack developer.
            I hope to create a personal website for myself during the course of the semester.
