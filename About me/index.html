            Hello, my name is Emmanuel, I come from Accra, Ghana in the Western Region of Africa. <br> 
            I am the second of four children, three boys and one girl and I am single. I really like everything that has to do with technology. <br>
            I am pursuing a degree in applied technology and hope to become a full stack developer or support specialist. <br> 
            I have tried creating websites without coding but now I want to do with coding. <br> I have learn the basics of programming and I found it really interesting. 
            It has made me develop the interest to learn web designing and programming. <br>In my free time, I love to play with my younger brothers,
            and also do some research on newer technologies. <br>My favorite cartoon anime is Naruto Shippuden and my favorite food is 
            Ghanaian Jollof rice with fried chicken.
        </p>
        <p>
            One thing I love about BYU is the way the gospel of Jesus Christ has been added to the <br>
            course structure to help student develop christlike attributes as they pursue their respective degrees. <br>
            Studying this course, I hope to gain much knowledge in web desgning and to become a fullstack developer. <br>
            I hope to create a personal website for myself during the course of the semester.
        </p>
        <p>I am ready to get started and look forward to successfully completing this semester with you all.</p>
